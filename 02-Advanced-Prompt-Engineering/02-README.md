# Advanced Prompt Engineering

## Overview

This unit focuses on advanced techniques for crafting and refining prompts to achieve desired outputs in various use cases.

Have you ever thought, "By the time I figure out how to properly prompt Copilot, I could just do it myself?"

If you have, you're not wrong! But for larger changes, especially starting from scratch, as well as for tedious tasks, Copilot can be immensely helpful.

Copilot provides a simple path forward to overcome "blank page syndrome."

Furthermore, prompt writing is a skill. The more you do it, the stronger that muscle becomes. Today, we're going to get a workout.
