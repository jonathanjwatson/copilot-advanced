# Activity 3: Building an App with Vercel's v0

Welcome to Activity 3! In this activity, we will explore the incredible power of Vercel's v0. Vercel's v0 is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly build and deploy applications with ease.

## Getting Started

### Creating an Account

1. Visit the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner.
3. Follow the instructions to create your account. You can sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account, or use your email address.

### Building a React App

Once you have created your account, you can start building your React app. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Vercel account.
2. Click on the "New Chat" button.
3. Ask v0 to generate a react app and hit `Enter`
4. Notice the specificity of the instructions compared to our previous activity.
5. If you feel comfortable with the instructions provided by v0, try and execute the commands on your local machine. 

Feel free to experiment and see what you can create!

### Questions

1. Were you concerned about running commands provided to your by an AI?
2. What differences (if any) did you noticed between the instructions and the actual setup? What is the potential problem here?
3. 

## Important Note

Please be aware that the free plan on Vercel is severely limited. You may encounter restrictions on build times, bandwidth, and other resources. 

To fully experience the capabilities of Vercel's v0, we will be demonstrating prompt engineering as a group activity on a paid plan. This will allow us to explore more advanced features and capabilities without the limitations of the free plan.

Happy coding!
