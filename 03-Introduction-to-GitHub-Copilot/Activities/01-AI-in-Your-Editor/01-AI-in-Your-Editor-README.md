# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the activity on GitHub Copilot! In this activity, you will learn about GitHub Copilot, its capabilities, and how it can assist you in your coding journey.

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It helps developers by suggesting code snippets, functions, and even entire algorithms based on the context of the code being written. Copilot leverages machine learning models trained on a vast amount of public code to provide intelligent code suggestions.

## Capabilities of GitHub Copilot

- **Code Completion**: Copilot can suggest the next line of code or even entire blocks of code based on the current context.
- **Function Suggestions**: It can suggest complete functions, including parameters and return values.
- **Code Documentation**: Copilot can help generate comments and documentation for your code.
- **Error Detection**: It can identify potential errors and suggest fixes.

## GitHub Copilot vs. Copilot Chat

While GitHub Copilot focuses on code completion and suggestions, Copilot Chat is an interactive feature that allows developers to ask questions and get answers related to their code. Copilot Chat can provide explanations, debugging help, and more detailed assistance compared to the inline suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are some common keyboard shortcuts to help you get the most out of GitHub Copilot:

- **Trigger Suggestion**: `Alt \`
- **Accept Suggestion**: `Tab` or `Enter`
- **Dismiss Suggestion**: `Esc`
- **Next Suggestion**: `Alt + ]` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + ]` (Mac)
- **Previous Suggestion**: `Alt + [` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + [` (Mac)

All these keybindings are customizable. Just open "Keyboard Shortcuts" and search "Copilot".

We hope this activity helps you understand and utilize GitHub Copilot effectively. Happy coding!
