# Activity: Using GitHub Copilot Chat to Explain a File

In this activity, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot Chat to get explanations for your code files. Sometimes, the explanations might be incomplete if certain values are stored in a separate constants file. We will guide you on how to include the constants file in Copilot Chat to get a more comprehensive explanation.

## Steps

1. **Open the File to be Explained**

   - Navigate to the file you want Copilot to explain. For this activity, let's assume the file is `main.js`.

2. **Ask Copilot for an Explanation**

   - Open GitHub Copilot Chat and ask for an explanation of the file. For example, you can type:
     ```
     Explain the contents of `main.js`.
     ```

3. **Identify Missing Information**

   - Review the explanation provided by Copilot. If you notice that some values are missing or unclear, it might be because they are defined in a separate constants file.

4. **Locate the Constants File**

   - Find the constants file that contains the missing values. For this activity, let's assume the constants file is `constants.js`.

5. **Add the Constants File to Copilot Chat**

   - In GitHub Copilot Chat, add the constants file so that Copilot can reference it. You can do this by typing:
     ```
     Include `constants.js` for reference.
     ```

6. **Regenerate the Explanation**

   - Ask Copilot to regenerate the explanation with the constants file included. For example:
     ```
     Explain the contents of `main.js` with reference to `constants.js`.
     ```

7. **Review the Updated Explanation**
   - Review the new explanation provided by Copilot. It should now include the values from the constants file, giving you a more complete understanding of the code.

## Example

Here is an example of how you might interact with Copilot Chat:

1. **Initial Request:**

   ```
   Explain the contents of `main.js`.
   ```

2. **Copilot Response:**

   ```
   The file `main.js` contains a function that calculates the total price. However, some values are missing.
   ```

3. **Add Constants File:**

   ```
   Include `constants.js` for reference.
   ```

4. **Regenerate Explanation:**

   ```
   Explain the contents of `main.js` with reference to `constants.js`.
   ```

5. **Updated Copilot Response:**
   ```
   The file `main.js` contains a function that calculates the total price using values from `constants.js`. The constants file defines the tax rate and discount values used in the calculation.
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that GitHub Copilot provides you with a complete and accurate explanation of your code files.

## Conclusion

Using GitHub Copilot Chat to explain your code can be very helpful, especially when dealing with multiple files. By including all relevant files in the chat, you can get a more comprehensive understanding of your code.
