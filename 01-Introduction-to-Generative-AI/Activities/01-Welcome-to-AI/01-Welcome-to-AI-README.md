# Welcome to AI

Welcome to the world of Generative AI! In this activity, we invite you to explore the fascinating realm of Large Language Models (LLMs) and understand how they differ from other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Unlike traditional AI, which might be designed for specific tasks, LLMs are versatile and can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, from translation to creative writing.

## How LLMs Differ from AI

While AI encompasses a broad range of technologies and applications, LLMs are specifically focused on understanding and generating natural language. Traditional AI might include image recognition, speech processing, or decision-making systems, whereas LLMs are specialized in text-based tasks.

## Sample Prompt to Compare Across AIs

To showcase the differences between these AI options, try the following prompt:

**Prompt:** "Write a short story about a robot learning to understand human emotions."

Compare the outputs from each AI to see how they handle creativity, coherence, and emotional depth.

### Questions:

1. What are the differences in these AI models?
2. How do you know which model is "best"?
3. How would you know if an AI is lying to you?
