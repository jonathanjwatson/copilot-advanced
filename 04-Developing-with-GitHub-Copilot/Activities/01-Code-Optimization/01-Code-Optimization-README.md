# Activity: Optimizing a Complex Fibonacci Function

## Objective

In this activity, you have been provided with a difficult to read function written in C# that outputs the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 values `initial-code.cs`. The goal is to use GitHub Copilot to optimize the code, making it easier to read and adding appropriate comments.

## Instructions

1. Review the provided C# function that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
2. Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in optimizing the code. Focus on improving readability and efficiency (if possible).
3. Add comments to the code to explain the logic and flow of the function.
4. Ensure the optimized code still correctly outputs the first 10 values of the Fibonacci sequence.

Do not edit the `initial-code.cs` file. Do your work in the `solution.cs` file. That way, if at any point in time you break your setup, you can copy/paste and start over.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should have a more readable and well-documented version of the original Fibonacci function. The optimized code should be easier to understand and maintain.
