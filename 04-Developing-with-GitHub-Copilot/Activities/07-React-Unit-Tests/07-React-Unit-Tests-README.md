# React Unit Tests

## Overview

We have converted our Payment Portal into a React component. Spend a few minutes looking through that React component and familiarizing yourself with the layout. Notice how we have streamlined the inputs into an array which can be mapped over and rendered.

## Task

Your task will be to write unit tests for this component using React Testing Library.

## Steps

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Component**: Spend a few minutes looking through the React component and understanding its structure and functionality.
2. **Write Simple Tests**: Start by asking Copilot to write simple tests to check if the component renders correctly.
3. **Improve Functionality**: Write tests to ensure that the component's functionality works as intended, such as form submission and validation.

One sample solution has been provided to you. Please reference ONLY after you have tried at least three prompts.
