```
Write an end-to-end test using Playwright for the PaymentPortal.jsx component, focusing on the happy path where the user enters all correct information and submits the form successfully.
```

```
update this test with a single describe block at the top. Add a second playwright test that shows the user entering bad data, confirms the error messages appear, and then has the user enter good data. Ensure the messages go away, and that the user can finally submit
```
