# Activity Instructions: Adding `data-testid` Attributes

Another team has just completed the `payment-portal.html` file. Now it's time to write tests. Unfortunately, the team forgot to add `data-testid` fields. Your task is to add these attributes to the HTML elements to facilitate testing.

## Steps to Follow

1. Open the `payment-portal.html` file.
2. Identify key HTML elements that will be targeted in your tests.
3. Add `data-testid` attributes to these elements. 

### Example

If you have an input field for the user's email, you might add a `data-testid` like this:

```html
<input type="email" id="user-email" data-testid="user-email-input">
```
