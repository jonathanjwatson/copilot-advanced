# Converting JavaScript to TypeScript

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will be provided with a sample JavaScript file. Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to convert the JavaScript code to TypeScript. This exercise will help you understand how to leverage GitHub Copilot to assist in code conversion and improve your TypeScript skills.

## Objectives

- Understand the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Learn how to use GitHub Copilot to assist in code conversion.
- Successfully convert a JavaScript file to TypeScript.

## Instructions

1. **Review the JavaScript File**: Familiarize yourself with the provided JavaScript file `my-algorithm.js`. You should be able to run the file with the following command:

```bash
    node 04-Developing-with-GitHub-Copilot/Activities/02-Converting-JavaScript/my-algorithm.js
```

NOTE: Right click on `my-algorithm.js` and "Copy Relative Path" to ensure proper location.

2. **Open the TypeScript File**: Notice the specific errors.

3. **Convert to TypeScript**:

   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist in converting the JavaScript code to TypeScript. Pay attention to type annotations and TypeScript-specific syntax.
   - Save your TypeScript file.

4. **Test**:

Using [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) test your new Typescript Code and ensure you get the same output in the console.

NOTE: THIS IS A TRICKY EXERCISE! 

* You may want to consider asking Copilot to modify chunks of code, rather than all at once. 
* You may still see linting errors in your editor. This is because we aren't actually in a typescript project.

Happy coding!
