# Accessibility Activity

## Overview

In this activity, you will be provided with a sample HTML page that does not meet accessibility guidelines. Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to optimize the page to meet accessibility standards. Ensuring your web pages are accessible is crucial, as failure to do so could result in costly lawsuits and alienate users with disabilities.

## Objectives

- Understand the importance of web accessibility.
- Identify common accessibility issues in HTML pages.
- Use GitHub Copilot to suggest and implement improvements.
- Validate the accessibility of the optimized HTML page.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Sample HTML Page**: Open the provided HTML file and review its content. Identify any accessibility issues, such as missing alt attributes, improper heading structure, lack of ARIA roles, etc.

2. **Use GitHub Copilot**: Utilize GitHub Copilot to suggest improvements to the HTML page. Pay attention to the following areas:

   - **Images**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes.
   - **Headings**: Use proper heading hierarchy (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
   - **Forms**: Label all form elements appropriately.
   - **ARIA Roles**: Add ARIA roles where necessary to improve screen reader compatibility.
   - **Color Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient color contrast against its background.

3. **Implement Changes**: Apply the suggested changes to the HTML page. Test the page using accessibility tools such as WAVE or Axe to ensure compliance.

4. **Validate Accessibility**: Use online tools like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and accessibility checkers to validate your optimized HTML page.

NOTE: You may run into issues with GitHub Copilot on this activity. How can you either A) get around any restrictions it may try and throw at you or B) use a different service?
