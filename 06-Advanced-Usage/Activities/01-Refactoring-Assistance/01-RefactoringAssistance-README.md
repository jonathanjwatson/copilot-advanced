# Refactoring Assistance Activity

## Objective

In this activity, you will use GitHub Copilot to refactor a React Class component into a functional component. This exercise will help you understand the differences between class and functional components and how to leverage GitHub Copilot to assist in the refactoring process.

## Instructions

1. **Identify the Class Component**

   - `client/Bio.jsx`

2. **Refactor to Functional Component**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in refactoring the class component into a functional component. Ensure that you:
     - Convert lifecycle methods to `useEffect` hooks.
     - Replace state management with the `useState` hook.
     - Update any other class-specific syntax to functional component syntax.

## Advanced

3. **Generate a Complex Class Component**

   - Try stretching the limits of GitHub copilot. Try asking it to setup Context, or Redux using the Class format.

4. **Refactor to Functional Component**
   - What does Copilot struggle with? Does it miss some hooks?
   - How could you optimize this process?
   - Does it work better going in stages? Or all at once?
